## Project 2: Facebook's React TicTacToe tutorial starter code

This repository contains the starter code for Facebook's React TicTacToe tutorial found here: [https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html)

Using this repo will allow you to build the tutorial and save your code locally instead of using a codepen.io web project.

## Getting started

- Fork this project
- clone your fork of this project
- `cd path/to/react-fb-tictactoe`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

Leave the `npm start` dev server running in the background, besides launching a dev server for react, it auto-compiles your react code changes, and it opens up your browser and auto-refreshes it anytime you make code changes.

Now open up the project code in your text editor and follow the tutorial, saving your changes as you go along.

> NOTE: You only need to edit the code in `./src/TicTacToe/index.js` for the tutorial.
